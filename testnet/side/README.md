Side Protocol is Omnichain's first modular exchange layer, offering a full stack as well as specialized infrastructure, tools, and applications for decentralized asset exchange.

What real problem does Side solve? Side Protocol solves various problems inherent in the web3 asset exchange space through a modular approach, with each component carefully designed using different mechanisms. Collectively, Side aims to provide a superior omnichain infrastructure and user experience, aiming to become the exchange layer in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Cross-chain and bridging capabilities: The emergence of new networks requires creating or replicating exchanges and liquidity infrastructures for each blockchain, which can be cumbersome and inefficient. Cross-chain and bridge solutions play a key role in solving this problem by allowing wrapped assets to be issued on a single platform (on the same chain), which facilitates interoperability between assets from different chains. However, growing concerns about the safety and integrity of bridges require careful design and robust protocols to ensure seamless and secure cross-chain communications. Blockchain technology scalability issues can seriously hinder DEX performance. It is critical to address the scalability issue to ensure that DEXs can handle a growing user base and transaction volume without sacrificing transaction speed or high costs. Challenges of CLOB-based DEXs: DEXs with a central limit order book (CLOB) are designed to provide a trading experience similar to centralized exchanges. However, their decentralized nature poses challenges related to performance, scalability, and usability, requiring innovative solutions to bridge the gap between centralized and decentralized trading paradigms. Problems with AMM-based DEXs: Volatile losses and slippage are part and parcel of DEXs with automated market makers (AMMs). Addressing these issues is critical to protecting the interests of both liquidity providers and traders, ensuring they can confidently engage with DEXs without fear of undue losses. Gas Fees: High gas fees are a significant deterrent, especially for smaller traders, when interacting with DEXs. Addressing the gas fee issue is critical to ensuring inclusive and cost-effective access to decentralized trading platforms for users of all trading volumes. User Interface and Experience: The inherent complexity of DEX interfaces can be intimidating for newcomers to the cryptocurrency space. Optimizing the user experience and simplifying the interface is necessary to attract a wider user base and ensure easy navigation of the platform for all users Product Diversity: Centralized exchanges (CEXs) often offer a full range of trading products to suit different user needs, unlike many decentralized exchanges (DEXs) which tend to focus on individual trading products. This limitation may discourage sophisticated traders who are looking for a variety of trading options and financial services. What makes Side stand out from the crowd? Side Protocol's design embodies a careful strategy aimed at solving prevailing problems in the field of decentralized exchanges. It consists of many independent but synergistic modules, each designed to perform distinct functions, reducing unnecessary complexity for users. This modular architecture not only facilitates permissionless integration, but also elevates Side Protocol as a modular exchange application layer, expanding its applicability to other blockchains and applications. Essentially, it is an exchange-as-a-service model serving dapps, chains, developers and users, helping to create a more user-centric, efficient and cost-effective asset exchange infrastructure.

Moreover, Side Protocol goes beyond a simple multi-chain protocol. It is capable of performing cross-chain atomic swaps and facilitating the exchange of assets between different blockchains without the use of bridges, using common message passing protocols instead. This omnichannel aspect greatly increases interoperability between chains, paving the way for more integrated and functional trading platforms.

Additionally, Side Protocol takes a full stack approach, going beyond a single exchange mechanism and offering a diverse range of exchange products. This aspect, coupled with its modular and omnichannel design, increases the protocol's potential to provide a convenient and diverse trading ecosystem, similar to the full suite of products typically found on centralized exchanges.
