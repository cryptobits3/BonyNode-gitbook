**Why is CrossFi technology unique?** CrossFi is a technology that expands the influence of blockchain and gives users the opportunity to use clear and accessible financial instruments every day anywhere in the world. CrossFi App is the first combination of financial services and functions of full-fledged banking, debit cards, a non-custodial model of mutual settlements and the absence of intermediaries in traditional financial services on the crypto market. Solutions based on CrossFi technology allow you to make: ● cross-border transactions without the intervention of Western financial institutions, ● tokenization of banking services and loyalty programs, ● fully integrated acquiring solutions using payment cards, POS terminals and self-service terminals. ● provision of ready-made electronic payment instruments, as well as a processing network of ATMs, trading terminals and e-commerce.\

**How is CrossFi security ensured?** ● Cross Chain is a blockchain that has a modular Tendermint architecture. The Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol is secure and eliminates fraud, since the Tendermint algorithm will automatically block nodes that transmit incorrect information during validation. ● The security and legality of XFI has been verified by Singapore's largest and oldest law firm. ● Listing XFI on one of the most high-performance crypto exchanges MEXC, one of the largest crypto exchanges Huobi. ● CrossFi App has been certified for compliance with the international PCI DSS security standard.
